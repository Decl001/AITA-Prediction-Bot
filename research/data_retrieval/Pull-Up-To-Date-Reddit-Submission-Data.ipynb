      "On the one hand, you really should have gotten explicit permission from every roommate before getting the cat. I'm allergic to cats and my quality of life would go way down if my roommate just decided to bring one home one day. On the other hand, you gave him a chance to say no and he just said \"meh\". I suspect you knew he didn't want you to get one but you did it anyway because he didn't actually SAY no, which is pretty assholey. The roommate is definitely an asshole for being so passive aggressive about everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd say both assholes, you for not caring about your roommate's desire to not have a cat, and him for being rude and passive aggressive about it.\n",
      "First things first, he's an asshole for treating the cat in that way, even if he regrets its presence in the house.  But you're not in the IsMyFlatmateTheAsshole sub, so lets move on to your own culpabilities here.\n",
      "\n",
      "While in theory your flatmate *could* have communicated his opposition when you were first getting the cat, at that point he would have been relatively uninformed about what having a kitten would mean.  And that *is* largely on you.  Not everybody sits around all day looking up what it means to care for a pet just on the off-chance that their flatmate will visit the rescue centre that day and spring the decision of whether to get a pet or not.  Forcing a decision on the same day was deeply irresponsible of you.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking on a pet is a significant decision that entails significant responsibility and patience, not just from you but from everybody in that living environment.  It is not the type of thing that can be sorted out quickly on WhatsApp.  I'm surprised the centre let you take the kitten so easily, last time I got a rescue cat it entailed a house visit and an interview with all the members of the household first.  If they weren't going to organise that, you should have, in that you should have had a communal meeting face-to-face with your housemates in which you made sure they were aware of the implications and downsides of what this would involve, and made sure they were onboard with that.  You do that both for their well-being, but mostly for the well-being of the animal you're about to take in.\n",
      "\n",
      "By being a negligent asshole then, too caught up in your own excitement to make sure your flatmates were informed and on board, you've put yourself in this current, difficult position.  You have to end his behaviour, either by removing the water gun and his attitude, or by removing the kitten from the situation if that is not possible.  The best way forwards probably begins with an apology from you to him.  He has legitimate grievances, he is expressing them in a totally unacceptable manner.  Try and address the grievances and make up for them, and from that basis rectify the problems he is causing now.\n",

You may disapprove of the spraying method, but I'm sure I could find a thousand sources saying it's effective (which I'm willing to bet is what your roommate did when he likely googled \"how to stop cat from jumping on furniture). \n",

Your decision greatly affected everyone in the house and needed full buy-in from all of the the roommates before you could proceed. Yes, your roommate could have responded with a better answer when you asked him... But it was your responsibility to understand his full feelings, and investigate any hesitation he may have shown. Hesitation that the 'Meh' answer clearly indicated. Buying that kitten was definitely an asshole move...\n",

      "Now, with that said, your roomate: He seems to have some passive aggressive tendencies and communication issues. Using a water gun on a cat is cruel, and passive aggressive. He is also an asshole for that. But you still forced this cat upon him and as he showed he would prefer not to have a cat (That's how I read his 'Meh' response) he really has no obligation to try and train your cat properly. These actions are just them acting out their anger towards your assholish move, buying the cat. The response you sent them (As shown in another post) will only suffice to stoke this anger and make matters worse. Take responsibility, apologize, don't throw blame at your roommate and maybe you can make up for your mistake...\n",

It's not like you can just give up the kitten now (You've accepted the immense responsibility for it for the next decade +), nor can you easily kick out your roommate (I'm assuming...). Welcome to the common drama that young pets cause amongst roommates... Everytime I've seen this in the past (half a dozen times amongst different people? Maybe more?) it ends with broken friendships, hard feelings, and someone moving out as quick as legally possible. And because you didn't discuss this fully beforehand, that's all on you...\n",

I will say that the cat getting squirted with water doesn't seem like a huge deal, but that's just me.\n",

      "You're not the asshole, and assuming that you really did explain \"nicely\" and he blew up at you about it, your roommate is a bit of an asshole for responding so adversarially. Perhaps he's been holding it in for a while and that's why his response was so over the top? It's hard to say from this one post.\n",

If I ask for permission to do something and someone says, \"Meh,\" I would probably ask a clarifying question, but if they didn't respond, I would assume that they don't really have a problem with it. So, if he didn't really convey that he didn't want you to get a cat at the time, then I don't think you're an asshole for getting a cat. Also kind of depends on who owns the lease and how you guys usually solve conflicts in the apartment.\n",
